    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
        9x13-inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make crust: Transfer 1 cup cake mix to a small bowl; set aside for
        topping. Place remaining cake mix in a medium bowl with melted butter
        and egg; mix until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>Spread mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        Make filling: Combine pumpkin puree, eggs, milk, brown sugar, and
        pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl; mix well and pour over crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make topping: Add white sugar and cubed butter to reserved cake mix; use
        a pastry blender to mix until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle over pumpkin filling, then scatter chopped walnuts over the
        top.
      </li>
